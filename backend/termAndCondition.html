            ‘Electronic Governance’ or what is usually
            called e-Governance, uses information and communication technologies (ICTs) such as wide area networks, the
            internet, and mobile computing at various levels of government and the public sector to enhance governance.
            However, e-Governance and e-Government are terms that often cause confusion. “e-Government” is a system that
            uses ICT to enhance government operations and procedures with the goal of boosting civic engagement and
            effectiveness, whereas e-Governance refers to the functionality that uses ICT to enhance a range and quality
            of services delivered to the citizens.
